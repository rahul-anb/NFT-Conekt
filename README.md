# NFT-Conekt
A simple NFT ownership tester trial through metamask with use of solidity and web3 / Molaris API.
Trial.html contains the UI interface, vid.html contains the page with the video which will open when the NFT ownership is verified and the test.html is the logic page which has the Molaris API which loads up the metamask extension on your brower throught which login info is verified. If login fails it does not open the page.
